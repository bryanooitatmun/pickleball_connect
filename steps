Flask Development Server and Database
For development, I recommend:

Database: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
Server: Flask's built-in development server for development, Gunicorn/uWSGI for production

Let's set up the initial database:
pythonCopy# Create a migration repository
flask db init

# Create the initial migration
flask db migrate -m "Initial database structure"

# Apply the migration to the database
flask db upgrade


Preventing Double Bookings
The updated database design incorporates several mechanisms to prevent double bookings:

Database constraints:

Unique constraint on Availability for coach_id, date, and start_time
Unique constraint on Booking for coach_id, date, and start_time


Two-phase booking process:

Availability marked as is_booked = True when booked
Transaction with rollback in the booking process


Concurrency handling:

Check if availability is still free just before creating a booking
Use database transaction to ensure atomicity



Deployment Recommendations
For a free or low-cost deployment, I recommend:

Database:

PostgreSQL on Railway.app (free tier)
Supabase (free tier)
ElephantSQL (free tier)


Application Hosting:

Render.com (free tier)
PythonAnywhere (free tier)
Fly.io (limited free tier)


Deployment Process:
bashCopy# Set environment variables
export FLASK_APP=run.py
export FLASK_ENV=production
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
export SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret-key

# Run migrations
flask db upgrade

# Start the production server
gunicorn run:app


Next Steps

Implement templates based on your HTML mockups
Add error handling and validation for all forms
Set up email notifications for bookings and cancellations
Add payment processing (Stripe is a good option)
Implement a search/filter system for finding coaches
Add testing with pytest
Set up logging for production

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this implementation or provide some template code for a particular page?
